I selected Mars Rovers,Sales Taxes and Trains projects.

1-) Mars Rovers;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   -> I created ArrayLists for positions, directions and instructions.
   -> You should give input like this ;
      -- upper right coordinate of plateau should be given in the first line.
      -- the lower left coordinates are assumed to be 0,0.
      -- in the second line, position and direction of rover should be given.
      -- The position is made two integers and a letter separated by spaces
      -- then instruction should be given in the next line.
   -> After the instruction lines, position,direction and instruction of the new rover can be given.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2-) Sales Taxes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ->  Number of goods should be given as the first element of lines.
   ->  Price of goods should be given as the last element of lines.
   ->  The rest of the lines is the name of the goods.
   ->  For exempt goods the words of "book","food" and "medical" must be used in the lines.
   ->  The word of "imported" must be used in the lines to know that this is an imported good.
